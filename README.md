# NLU Data Processing

The purpose of this engine is to serve as an Intent Recognition Model for integration into various programs and systems. It refines and clarifies user queries, enabling more accurate and relevant search or action results. For instance, programs can incorporate this engine within a search bar to effectively parse and narrow down the user's intent, thereby enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the responses or actions generated

# NOTE AS OF 8/31/2025:
This intent recognition model was an earlier step in the project’s evolution. It focuses on identifying user intent well but doesn't generate a response to the user's query. This can still be a solid choice if that’s all you require.

That said, it has largely been superseded by the [**Dynamic Learning Model (DLM)**](https://github.com/VigneshT24/Dynamic_Learning_Model), which builds on this work by both recognizing intent and generating responses. For most modern use cases, the DLM will be the more suitable option.
