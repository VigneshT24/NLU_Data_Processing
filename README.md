# Python NLU Data Processing

# This project replicates a basic version of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) that takes user input, usually a question, commonly asked to a Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, Cortana, etc., to understand what the user is asking and possibly perform an appropriate action. The purpose is to embed this program into a robotic system that can understand and interpret human language as a first step to taking action. 

# NLU Engine Name: Quadra Engine

# The "NLU Class" file contains all of the code for the Quadra NLU
