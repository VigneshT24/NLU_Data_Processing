# Python NLU Data Processing

# This project replicates a basic version of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) that takes user input, usually a question, commonly asked to a Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, Cortana, etc., to understand what the user is asking and possibly perform an appropriate action. The purpose of this engine is to be used by other programs and systems as an INTENT RECOGNITION MODEL, narrowing down the query by the user so that it improves search/action results.

# NLU Engine Name: Quadra Engine

# The "NLU Class" file contains all of the code for the Quadra NLU
